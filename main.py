"""
Sample app to demonstrate the entire flow of keeping mobile entitlements up-to-date
with RevenueCat.

The primary goal for this sample code is to be easy to understand.

The only third-party dependencies required are:
- Bottle - lightweight WSGI framework for receiving HTTP webhooks from RevenueCat
- requests - make HTTP request to RevenueCat API
- certifi - keeps the TLS certificate bundles up to date
- pipenv - for installing the above dependencies
